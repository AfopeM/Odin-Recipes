        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. In a large skillet
                over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add chicken and cook until
                golden, 4 minutes per side. Remove from skillet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce heat to medium and add remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Add shallot and
                mushrooms and cook until golden, 5 minutes. Add garlic, thyme, and oregano
                and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more. Add broth and scrape up any brown
                bits on bottom of pan, then slowly add in half and half. Bring to a simmer
                and season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Stir in
                gnocchi and return chicken to pan. Let simmer until chicken is cooked
                through and internal temperature reaches 165Â°, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring
                occasionally. Remove chicken from skillet.
            </li>

                Add cheeses and stir until melted, then add spinach and stir until wilted.
            </li>

                Slice chicken and return to skillet. Season with more salt and pepper to taste.
