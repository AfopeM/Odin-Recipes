        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> A longtime favorite of Delish readers, this savory-sweet salmon never
            disappoints. Searing fish might seem intimidating but, once you get the hang
            of it, it'll be second nature. Just follow these easy tips:
            <span>Check for bones</span>
            The average pack of portioned super market salmon typically doesn't
            have any remaining pin bones to worry about. But it's definitely
            best practice to double check.

        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together honey, soy sauce, lemon juice and red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat two tablespoons oil.
                When oil is hot but not smoking, add salmon skin-side up and season with salt
                and pepper. Cook salmon until deeply golden, about 6 minutes, then flip over
                and add remaining tablespoon of oil.

            <li>Add garlic to the skillet and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the honey
                mixture and sliced lemons and cook until sauce is reduced by about 1/3.
                Baste salmon with the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Garnish with sliced lemon and serve.</li>
